Notes for the "Great HDF5Dataset Merge" (in which I completely change the
backing DGGS format with 10 days left in the project)

* Here's how I was parsing dates before:

		IHDF5StringReader stringReader = fp.string();
		String dateString = stringReader.getAttr("/", "datetime");
		obsDate = OffsetDateTime.parse(dateString);

  I can't do that any more because I'm storing dates differently. Oh well.

* I'm marking things I need to revist with "TODO REFAC"

* "Dataset" is stupid. Instead, I'm calling the various AGDC datasets which we
  support "products". That should make the code a lot less confusing.

* Here's how I was reading pixels before:

		pixelValue = fp.readDoubleArray(path + "/pixel");
